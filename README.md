# Candlestick Probability Analysis

This is a Streamlit application that analyzes market patterns based on historical data and provides a probability analysis for future patterns.

## How It Works

The application takes a stock ticker symbol, a time frame, and other parameters to analyze the market patterns and visualizes the most likely next patterns based on historical occurrences.

## Features

- User inputs for ticker symbol, start and end dates, interval, and RSI period.
- Interactive analysis with Streamlit.
- Visual representation of results with Matplotlib and Seaborn.

## Prerequisites

Before you can run the app, you'll need to install the required Python libraries:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running the App

To run the app locally, navigate to the root directory of the project, and execute:

```
